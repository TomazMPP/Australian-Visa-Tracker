## **Description**  
The **Australian Visa Tracker** is a powerful web application designed to help users check and analyze processing times for various Australian visa types. While the official Australian government website provides this data, it can be less user-friendly and harder to navigate. This project aims to simplify the process by offering a clean, intuitive interface and advanced features like historical data analysis and visa comparison.

Beyond its practical use, this project was also an opportunity for me to **practice and enhance my skills**. By building my own **RESTful API** and integrating it with a modern tech stack, I gained hands-on experience in full-stack development, data analysis, and user-centric design. 


## **Tech Stack** 
- **Frontend**: Tailwind, JavaScript, React.js  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL    
- **Deployment**: Render (Backend & Database) + Vercel (Frontend) - All hosted in Singapore region.

## **Features**   
- **Visa Processing Times**: Check current processing times for multiple Australian visa types.  
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Explore trends and patterns in visa processing times. 
- **Interactive Charts**: Visualize data with easy-to-understand graphs and charts.  
- **Insights & Tips**: Get valuable insights and tips for planning your visa application.
